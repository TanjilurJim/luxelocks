            <p class="font-bold text-black">What About Cookies and Other Identifiers?</p>

            <p class="font-bold">Does Luxelocks Share Your Personal Information?</p>
            <p>Information about our clients is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling
                our
                clients’ personal information to others. We share clients’ personal information only as described below and
                with
                subsidiaries newtimeshair.com that either is subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as
                protective
                as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Third-Party Service Providers:</span> We employ other companies and individuals to
                perform functions on our behalf. Examples
                include fulfilling orders for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email,
                analyzing data,
                providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), and
                providing
                customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform
                their
                functions, but will not use it for other purposes.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Protection of Luxelocks and Others:</span> We release accounts and other
                personal information when we believe release is
                appropriate to comply with the law; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Luxelocks, our
                users, or
                others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and
                credit risk
                reduction.</p>
            <p>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with
                third
                parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>
            <p class="font-bold">How Secure Is Information About Me?</p>
            <p>We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind.</p>
            <p>We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption
                protocols and
                software.</p>
            <p>We follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling credit card data.</p>
            <p>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and
                disclosure
                of personal client information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of
                identity before
                we disclose personal information to you.</p>
            <p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers,
                devices, and
                applications. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>

            <p><span class="font-bold">Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:</span> We provide ad companies with
                information that allows them to serve you with
                more useful and relevant Luxelocks ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or
                other
                information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a
                cookie or
                other device identifier.</p>
