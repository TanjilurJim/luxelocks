            <h2 class="font-bold text-[24px]">PURCHASES AND PAYMENT</h2>
            <p>Luxelocks starts processing any returned products within 24 working hours after we receive the return.
                The
                processing time varies on a case-by-case basis. We will only replace or refund after we have received the
                products.
                We take no responsibility for returns lost by postal services. The shipping cost of return would be assumed
                by Luxelocks if we caused the problems that lead to the return. Otherwise, the cost would be assumed by
                customers
                solely.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Stock hair systems:</span></p>
            <p>You will receive a full refund minus shipping if all stock hair systems that are uncolored, uncut, and have
                not been
                used in any way within 30 days after purchase.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Custom hair systems:</span></p>
            <p>All custom hair systems (except for special mesh material such as ultra-thin skin and Swiss lace) may be
                repaired or
                remade or refunded free of charge upon our mistake or production fault within 3 months from delivery to
                receipt of
                return.</p>
            <p>If you cancel a custom order before you receive it, you will only receive a 50% refund in order to cover
                labor and
                material costs.</p>
            <p>If you order a wrong custom-made hair system by mistake, the hair system cannot be returned for a refund. If
                you
                would like us to adjust it, extra cost will be charged accordingly including shipping.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Repair orders:</span></p>
            <p>No refunds are offered for repair under any condition.</p>
            <p>Products that need to be adjusted again must be returned within 30 days after receiving.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Notes:</span> We CANNOT replace all the hair on the hair system. We replace loose
                hair with new hair.
                However, over time old hair will continue to loosen and shed.</p>
            <p>While repair prolongs hair system lifespan, it is a short-term solution. The only long-term solution is to
                buy a new
                hair system.</p>
            <p><span class="font-bold">Accessories:</span></p>
            <p>Products must be returned within 30 days after you receive them.</p>
            <p>Refund can only be given if the packaging is unopened.</p>
            <h2 class="font-bold text-[24px]">RUSH DELIVERY TERMS</h2>
            <p>In general, terms rush production services allow customers to receive hairpieces quicker than they would
                normally under
                standard conditions. We give a general guideline of 6-8 weeks for “rush” service. In no way do we guarantee
                an exact
                date or timetable for this service. All hairpieces are custom made and as such no exact time can be
                guaranteed. This
                service means production will be faster than if customers were to choose standard delivery. NO REFUNDS will
                be made
                for“rush” fees resulting from delays. However, at the discretion of Luxelocks.com, we may credit
                the“rush” fee if the
                production is unusually past the“rush” time schedule.</p>
